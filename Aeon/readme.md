#AEON Framework
The AEON Framework is a versatile Component-Entity system originally engineered for Sample Game.

#Core library
The Core directory contains the entity framework and utility classes

#Plugins
Aeon is capable of dynamically loading plugins. Plugins usually provide specific functionality; two ship with the
core library by default:

* AeonSubsystem, a library providing common abstract subsystems required for games (Input, Audio, UI, Renderer)
* AeonCompress, a zlib wrapper providing capabilities to read zip files.
* AeonXML, an eXpat wrapper, providing a SAX based XML parser.
